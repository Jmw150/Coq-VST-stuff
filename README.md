# Symbolic artificial intelligence

### Motivation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence

GOFAI (Symbolic heavy artificial intelligence) is an area with a rich history and a lot of problems to solve. It is an useful area for any AI researcher/practitioner.

### Background

- Logical solvers (automated reasoning)

    - usecases: analytic solvers (neural nets, vectopr machines, etc) handle low computation high convergence problems

    - starter literature:

    - tools:
        SMT: https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3

- Program synthesis

    - usecases: generative programs, self healing code, constraint based programming

    - starter literature:

    - tools:
        

- Program verification

    - usecases: software security, mathematical proof writing, reducing long term maintenance of software
