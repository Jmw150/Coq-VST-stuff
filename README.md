# Symbolic artificial intelligence

### Background


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence

GOFAI (Symbolic heavy artificial intelligence) is an area with a rich history and a lot of problems to solve. Such things include

- Logical solvers
    - automated reasoning: SMT, model extensions, adaptive programs

- Program synthesis
    - generative programs, self healing code, constraint based programming

- Program verification
    - useful in software security, mathematical proof writing

### Current research

Research on this area can be found in these communities: 
- PL community (POPL/PLDI/OOPSLA), 
- Formal Methods community (CAV/TACAS) 
- ML community (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR).
