### Motivation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence

GOFAI (Symbolic heavy artificial intelligence) is an area with a rich history and a lot of problems to solve. It is an useful area for any AI researcher/practitioner.

### Subdisiplines

- Logical solvers (automated reasoning)

    - usecases: 
        analytic solvers (neural nets, vector machines, etc) handle low computation high convergence problems, while logical solvers handle non-convergent or high precision problems

    - starter literature: http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/

    - tools:
        (SMT) https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3

- Program synthesis (AI side of compiler research)

    - usecases: generative programs (synthesisers), self healing code, constraint based programming

    - starter literature:
            https://sygus.org/language/

    - tools:
            https://github.com/purdue-cap/DryadSynth
        

- Program verification 

    - usecases: software security, mathematical proof writing, reducing long term maintenance of software

    - starter literature:
        https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/

    - tools:

        - light verification aware language: https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny

        - Proof language Coq: https://coq.inria.fr/



### Current research

Research on this area can be found in these communities: 
- PL community (POPL/PLDI/OOPSLA), 
- Formal Methods community (CAV/TACAS) 
- ML community (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR).
